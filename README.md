# EverFlowy

Sync your workflowy's items into evernote.

## Status

Now, by use the dev_token of evernote sandbox, I can sync the items of workflowy to evernote successfully:

If you change the text in your workflowy, then the item will be updated to evernote, too.

What I will do is enable it in the normal mode out of sandbox and use the Oauth2 get the access token of other
account.
